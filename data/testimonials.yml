    content: My North Channel trip in the Pursuit 2200 went well this year except it was wetter that we would have preferred. The new side curtains and aft curtain performed excellently at keeping us dry and comfortable. Very pleased. One of the other boaters that traveled along with us told me "I am impressed with your new canvas". I'll definitely be back when I need more work done. Bill Brace

    content: Chris, You are a genious! Curtains fit like a Saville row bespoke suit. Easy to install and we got them perfectly centered on the tracks. Beautiful. Friends thought I was nuts to spend 50 grand on my 15 year old boat but it is perfect, up to date, and it maxes out my boathouse. Your perfectly made curtains are the final touch.I appreciate craftsmen like you and my boat mechanic Tom. It makes boat ownership easy Larry Marsland Marsland Centre Limited
- "Larry Van Lare":
    content: Hey Chris, Thanks so much for making the side curtains on the dodger of my sailboat. It was such short notice on my part compounded by the circumstances of your move. But you handled everything so well, and the result was just as I envisioned and as you described. You have always been the person I preferred to do my canvas work over these past 15 or 20 years although I did not always get you. But your respect for your customers, your knowledge of the proper and best way to complete a project, and your consument skill in pattern making for a perfect fitting result put you head and shoulders above everyone else. And thanks so much for chasing me up the shore to complete the installation. You certainly went well beyond the limits of good service to accommodate my trials. Sincerely, Larry Van Lare

    content: Chris, We are into our 4th year and over 8,000 miles of cruising since you completed our extended cockpit enclosure with panels, screens, and Rainer side windows. The majority of this cruising has been in salt water, and they are still looking terrific! The space functions as an extended living area, and remains completely dry in rain squalls and rough seas. Again, a WELL DONE to you and your team for exceeding our expectations. Best Regards, Tom & Sue m/v Marbles
- "Bob Schuitema":
    content: Hi Chris, Our launch was flawless yesterday and we kept warm en route to Saugatuck. The Rainier enclosure is beautiful and will need your training on how to operate the sophisticated double track system. Thanks again, Chris, the project is terrific. . . . . well done. Regards, Bob Schuitema

    content: '“I worked with Chris on my fishing boat in order to build a comfortable and complete top with side curtains. He was creative, accommodating and provided the necessary expert knowledge to ensure that the top would be placed correctly, sturdy and long-lasting. I love the top -- it keeps the sun off in the heat and the rain off in the storms. The windshield and side curtains are awesome - keeping the rain and the waves off myself and my family. Chris and his firm do excellent work!” Top qualities: Great Results, Expert, High Integrity Christopher Wysong Hemco Gages PH: 616.396.4604'

- "The Anchorage Yacht Sales Team":
    content: Chris, we’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you for the excellent service you have provided to our clients. A lot of times when we go to list a boat that we are going to sell we can tell even before we get aboard whether you did the canvas or someone else. That seems funny but there is an absolute difference in the quality of work that you offer in terms of fit, finish and detail. Whenever we have a customer in need of canvas, you are the only recommendation that we make- we are that confident that our customers are going to be more than satisfied in your work. Not only do our clients get to enjoy their quality canvas job while they’re out boating, but they also enjoy the better resale price that they get from having it done by Canvas Innovations. The Anchorage Yacht Sales Team Matt Loew, Lou Hebert, Jon Dykstra

    content: Dear Chris – I just wanted to drop you a line to thank you for doing such a great job serving my business and my clients over the last ten years. Your work is second to none, and you always go the extra mile making sure everyone is satisfied with your work. Any customer that I’ve ever sent your way has been elated with the job you’ve done. In this business, you only make recommendations when you know you can believe in the results, and I have always and will continue to make Canvas Innovations our first recommendation for any type of canvas or enclosure work. Thanks again Chris. Sincerely, Josh Van Howe Coral Gables Yachts Holland, MI 49423 www.coralgablesyachts.com

    content: The Rainier windows designed and installed by Chris Ritsema and his staff have worked out great! This project was a rebuild with a tricky set of curvatures going in two diferent planes between the existing lower windshield and the new hardtop. It's been water tight in some heavy rain storms and open water conditions, it keeps the heat out of the helm area , it's "clear as a bell" from the inside and looks super from the outside.
