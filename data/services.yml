    description: "Canvas Innovations offers all exterior and interior carpet installations.
For exterior applications we offer high quality marine grade carpets. Aqua-loc brand carpets are a pvc backed mat that range from 20 to 40oz pile and work best with exterior snap-in applications.
We can use your old carpet as a pattern or for that owner who wants a tight custom fit we can pattern it to fit around seating, pedestal mounts or whatever is necessary. Once the carpets are cut we have “in house” binding services to finish all edging. Finally we return the completed mat to the boat and install any needed snaps.
For interior applications we can do tear-outs and re-installations of most makes and models. Estimates available upon request."
